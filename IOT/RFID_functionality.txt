----------
Pin:
----------

Vcc: Used to Power the module, typically 3.3V is used

RST: Reset pin – used to reset or power down the module

Ground: Connected to Ground of system

IRQ: Interrupt pin – used to wake up the module when a device comes into range

MISO: MISO pin when used for SPI communication, acts as SCL for I2c and Tx for UART.

MOSI: Master out slave in pin for SPI communication

SCK: Serial Clock pin – used to provide clock source

SS/SDA/Rx: Acts as Serial input (SS) for SPI communication, SDA for IIC and Rx during UART
