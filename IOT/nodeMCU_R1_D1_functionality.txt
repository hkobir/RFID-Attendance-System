Digital Pins:
The Arduinoâ€™s digital pins read only two states : when there is voltage on an input pin and when there is not. 
This kind of input is usually called digital ( or sometimes binary for two state). These states are commonly referred to as HIGH and LOW. 

Analog pin:
Sometime we couldn't represent our hardware equipment into two state, such as some sensors which value is continuously change. On that time
we need analog pins.
